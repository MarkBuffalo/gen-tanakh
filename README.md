# Gen-Tanakh

## What is this?

This is a project that allows you to generate a `Hebrew - English Bible` according to the Masoretic Text and the JPS 1917 Edition, then parse it into a full-scope Tanakh stored in `tanakh.json`.

### Some notes

- The contents are already provided in this library, unzipped.
